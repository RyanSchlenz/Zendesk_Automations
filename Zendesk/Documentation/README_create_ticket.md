Overview
This script automates the process of creating a new ticket in Zendesk using the Zendesk API. It retrieves the necessary credentials from a separate file, prepares the ticket data, sends a POST request to the Zendesk API endpoint, and handles the response to confirm whether the ticket creation was successful.

Breakdown of code
Importing Required Modules and Variables: The script begins by importing the necessary modules (requests and json) for making HTTP requests and working with JSON data. It also imports variables (username, api_token, url) from a separate file (zendesk_credentials.py) that contain the Zendesk API credentials and URL.

Preparing Ticket Data: The script defines a dictionary ticket_data containing the data for creating a new ticket in Zendesk. This includes the subject and body of the ticket.

Converting Ticket Data to JSON: The ticket_data dictionary is converted to JSON format using the json.dumps() function. This is necessary because Zendesk's API expects data to be in JSON format when creating a new ticket. Setting Up Request Headers: The script sets up the request headers, specifying that the data being sent in the request is in JSON format (Content-Type: application/json).

Making API Request to Create Ticket: Using the requests.post() function, the script sends a POST request to the Zendesk API endpoint (url) to create a new ticket. It includes the JSON payload (payload) containing the ticket data, and it authenticates using the provided username (email address with /token appended) and API token.

Handling Response: The script checks the response from the API. If the status code is 201 (indicating success), it prints a success message along with the ID of the newly created ticket. Otherwise, it prints an error message along with the status code and response text returned by the API.
