**Overview**
This Python script interacts with the Zendesk API to log macro activity. It fetches all macros from a specified Zendesk instance and logs them into a file. The script is designed to run periodically, typically at intervals, to capture any changes in macros over time.

Upon execution, it appends the current list of macros, along with their creation and update timestamps, to the top of the log file. This helps maintain a historical record of macros and their respective timestamps. The script continuously runs in a loop, periodically checking for updates to the macros and updating the log file accordingly.

The script aims to provide administrators or users with insights into the evolution of macros within their Zendesk instance, facilitating tracking and monitoring of changes over time. It enhances transparency and accountability by maintaining a detailed log of macro activity.

**Code Breakdown**
Fetching Macros: The fetch_all_macros() function sends a request to the Zendesk API to retrieve all macros from the specified Zendesk instance. It handles errors and returns the fetched macros as a JSON object.
Prepending Current Macros: The prepend_current_macros_to_log() function fetches the current macros and appends them to the top of the log file. It also includes the date and time of the script's last execution. This function ensures that the log file always contains the latest macro information.

Logging Macro Activity: The script continuously runs in a loop, periodically checking for macro updates. If any changes are detected, it updates the log file accordingly. The script sleeps for a specified interval between iterations to avoid excessive API requests.

Error Handling: Error handling is implemented throughout the script to handle potential exceptions, such as failed API requests or file operations. Any encountered errors are printed to the console for visibility and troubleshooting.

Configuration: The script allows for configuration via variables such as LOG_FILE_PATH, allowing users to specify the location where the log file will be saved. Additionally, users need to provide Zendesk credentials (username, API token, subdomain) in a separate file (zendesk_credentials.py) for authentication with the Zendesk API.
