Overview
This Python script facilitates the deletion of macros within a Zendesk instance using the Zendesk API. It allows users to specify the name of the macro they want to delete, finds the corresponding macro by name, and sends a request to the Zendesk API to delete the macro if it exists. The script provides feedback on the success or failure of the macro deletion operation.

Code Breakdown
Macro Deletion Functions:
The fetch_all_macros() function retrieves a list of all macros from the Zendesk instance by sending a GET request to the Zendesk API endpoint for macros.

The find_macro_by_name(name) function searches for a macro with a specified name within the list of fetched macros. If found, it returns the macro object; otherwise, it returns None.

The delete_macro_by_name(name) function deletes a macro with the specified name by calling the find_macro_by_name() function to locate the macro and sending a DELETE request to the Zendesk API endpoint for macro deletion. If the deletion is successful (HTTP status code 204), it prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message.

Example Usage:
The script's main block demonstrates the usage of the delete_macro_by_name() function. It specifies the name of the macro to be deleted and calls the function to perform the deletion operation. If the macro deletion is successful, it prints a success message. If the macro is not found or the deletion fails, it prints a corresponding error message.

Error Handling:
The script includes error handling mechanisms to handle potential failures during the macro deletion process. It raises HTTP errors for non-200 status codes during macro retrieval (fetch_all_macros()) and prints error messages for failed macro deletions.

Configuration:
Users need to provide Zendesk API credentials (username, API token, zendesk_api_url) in a separate file (zendesk_credentials.py) for authentication with the Zendesk API. The script utilizes these credentials to authenticate and authorize API requests.
