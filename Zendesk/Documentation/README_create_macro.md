Overview
This Python script facilitates the creation of macros within a Zendesk instance using the Zendesk API. It allows users to define the title and actions of a macro and sends a request to the Zendesk API to create the macro with the specified details. The script provides feedback on the success or failure of the macro creation operation.

Code Breakdown
Macro Creation Function: The create_macro() function is responsible for creating a new macro in Zendesk. It constructs the API request payload with the macro's title and actions, sends a POST request to the Zendesk API endpoint, and handles the API response. If the macro creation is successful (HTTP status code 201), the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False and prints an error message.

Example Usage: The script's main block demonstrates the usage of the create_macro() function. It defines a sample macro name and actions, calls the function to create the macro, and prints a success message if the operation is successful. If the macro creation fails, it prints a corresponding error message.

Error Handling: The script provides basic error handling to detect and handle failures during the macro creation process. It prints error messages to the console to inform users about any encountered issues, allowing for easy troubleshooting.

Configuration: Users need to provide Zendesk API credentials (username, API token, zendesk_api_url) in a separate file (zendesk_credentials.py) for authentication with the Zendesk API. The script utilizes these credentials to authenticate and authorize API requests.
